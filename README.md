# N‑Up Printing Calculator (FileSplice)

A minimal, dependency‑free web app to illustrate and calculate N‑Up imposition. Enter your page size and item size; the tool computes how many items fit (N) and renders a live preview.

**Backlink notice:** By default, the UI includes a small attribution link back to [FileSplice](https://filesplice.com/). If you use this code, please keep the link visible. (See `index.html` for the exact snippet, marked clearly.)

## Features
- Simple inputs: page width/height, item width/height (inches)
- Auto‑calculates maximum columns/rows and total **N**
- Live visual preview with padding control
- No build step required — just open `public/index.html`

## Quick Start
1. Download this repo (or clone from your GitHub).
2. Open `public/index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Optionally host from any static server.

## Embed on WordPress
- Upload the `/public` folder to your site and embed via an iframe or copy the HTML into a custom block.
- Fonts and styles are self‑contained.

## Attribution / Backlink
